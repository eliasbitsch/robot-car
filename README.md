🚗 Robotic Car Controller 🎮
This project is a robotic car that can be controlled using a custom controller. It consists of a 3-wheeled car with 2 DC geared motors and a front wheel, an Arduino Uno, an NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz wireless RF transceiver module, a Mini Motor Drive Shield - L293D Module, an on/off switch, LEDs, an ultrasonic sensor, and it can be powered using either a 9V battery or USB.

The custom controller uses an Arduino Uno, an NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz wireless RF transceiver module, a joystick, buttons, an LCD display, a buzzer, and it can also be powered using either a 9V battery or USB. The controller also allows for fine tuning of the car's trajectory using the "Spur trimmen" feature, and it provides various feedback through the serial monitor on the controller, such as the central locking system, light assistant, and brake lights.

Usage
To use the robotic car controller, follow these steps:

Assemble the robotic car by connecting the various components as described in the documentation.
Assemble the custom controller by connecting the various components as described in the documentation.
Power on both the car and the controller.
The controller will display the available options on the LCD display. Use the joystick and buttons to select the desired option.
Control the car using the joystick and buttons on the controller. Fine-tune the car's trajectory using the "Spur trimmen" feature.
