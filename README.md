# 🚗 Robotic Car Controller 🎮

Welcome to the **Robotic Car Controller** project! This project features a custom-built controller to navigate and control a 3-wheeled robotic car. The car and controller communicate wirelessly, offering a seamless and interactive experience.

## Project Overview

This robotic car setup includes:

- **3-wheeled car**: Equipped with 2 DC geared motors and a front wheel for movement and stability.
- **Arduino Uno**: The brain behind the car's operations.
- **NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz wireless RF transceiver module**: Ensures reliable communication between the car and the controller.
- **Mini Motor Drive Shield - L293D Module**: Powers and controls the car's motors.
- **On/Off switch and LEDs**: For power control and status indication.
- **Ultrasonic sensor**: Enables obstacle detection and avoidance.
- **Power options**: Use either a 9V battery or USB for flexibility.

### The Custom Controller

The controller is designed for ease of use and fine control, featuring:

- **Arduino Uno**: Handles user inputs and wireless communication.
- **NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz wireless RF transceiver module**: Maintains a steady link with the car.
- **Joystick and buttons**: Allow intuitive control over the car's movements.
- **LCD display**: Provides real-time feedback and options.
- **Buzzer**: Alerts and sound signals during operation.
- **Spur trimmen feature**: Fine-tunes the car's trajectory for precise control.
- **Power options**: Like the car, the controller can be powered using a 9V battery or USB.

## 🚀 Usage

To operate the robotic car with the custom controller, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble the Robotic Car**: Connect all the components as outlined in the documentation.
2. **Assemble the Custom Controller**: Follow the assembly instructions in the documentation to connect the controller components.
3. **Power On**: Switch on both the car and the controller.
4. **Navigate the LCD Display**: The controller will show available options. Use the joystick and buttons to select your desired operation mode.
5. **Control the Car**: Steer the car using the joystick. Fine-tune its trajectory with the "Spur trimmen" feature for enhanced precision.
